Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect and monitor wildlife using NEURAL NETWORK techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various wildlife species. The project aims to facilitate the study and conservation of wildlife by providing an efficient way to detect and monitor wildlife in natural habitats.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in this repository. It consists of images of different wildlife species, which are used to train and validate the machine learning model.

Project Presentation
The PowerPoint presentation of the project is available in the current repository as well . It provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, and results.

Project Documentation
The project documentation, which can be found in the repository, provides detailed information about the project, including the project structure, model architecture, and implementation details.
